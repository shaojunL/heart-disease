## About
This is our mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Predicting Heart Disease. [(Dataset)](heart.csv). 
Please view our code in order from:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Resampling and Splitting
4. Decision Tree Classification
5. Logistic Regression

## Problem Definition
* Which factor is most useful when predicting the possibility of Heart Disease for people above 50 years of age?
* Which model is best to predict the possibility of Heart Disease?

## Models Used
* Decision Tree Classification
* Logistic Regression

## Conclusion
*  The most important factors in predicting whether one would have Heart Disease in descending order is : MaxHR, Cholesterol, RestingBP

Reasons:
*  From our boxplot, cholestrol had the most significant difference
*  MaxHR appeared highest in Decision Tree
*  MaxHR had the highest accuracy as well as magnitude for its coefficient for Logistic Regression

## What did we learn from this project?
* Handling imbalanced datasets with upsampling
* Logistic Regression
* Collaborating through Github
* Removing Duplicates
